### Part 2 (75 pts)

This particular scenario to me seems to revolve around the case of responsible disclosure. There is an issue which you have identified, and it is now your task to delegate it appropriately so that these problems can be mitigated. Choosing the wrong entity to notify can have disastrous consequences, and in this case, any external body to the company is the wrong choice. For one, the prompt gives us that the company has not rolled this firmware out for production, which means it is currently not endangering any consumers. Relegating these security issues to QA teams and other stakeholders would be the correct first choice so they can take steps to fix them, as well as discover other potential issues that crop up. Some may say that you have a responsibility to the people to make sure the products they use are safe, but by disclosing this information to outside groups, you may actually be causing harm as people attempt 'hacky' methods to subvert the new firmware or continue using old and outdated firmware which may have its own issues. If no action is taken by the company, then it is time to look towards reputable governing bodies or groups which can affect some change with the information. This is especially true if there are no plans for halting the release of these flawed products which can seriously endanger users. The benefit of government groups or institutions is that they can severely enforce consequences on private companies, and furthermore, they can potentially hold intimate details of the issues, which if released to the public, could allow technically-endowed individuals to create exploitative attacks that were considered before. Finally, if there is still no action, these security concerns should be shared with the public via trustworthy mediums and publishers. Past the point of notifying governing entities, any harm that occurs will not be your fault. The groups and people you have notified have enough oversight to fix these issues before interacting with consumers, and they should be held responsible. At the early stage, right after the discovery of these issues, not informing the right people can certainly make you responsible for the harm that occurs, as you are the only one aware of the problems, and you deliberately kept silent.
